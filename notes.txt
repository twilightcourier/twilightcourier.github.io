Ok need to make header bigger 
change the food of VJ Demo header
Get this photos to line up in grids of 4 by default if size is Okand move the margin over a bit
It should redirect to a new page with some embeddd videos, and then link to gum road on the page?

add works page and just copy and paste once you get it set up
I guess its annoying if you want to change it later, but it works for now 
Probably just make a css like works css and then change that later if you want

Then link this to each gumroad page and some youtube video

add footer and privacy policy
copyright

setup contact emailand add a photo of it

Automate add header to every page

Get photo CSS grid layout

Add that banner thing? Would be nice if entries for example auto added to the banner

And maybe automate some stuff in React like Margo did.
O_o or can I just use JavaScript?

add a note and some photos to contact and set up that email
